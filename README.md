## About this project

Imagine a restaurant or pub that has two or more floors or several halls for visitors. On weekends, most restaurants are usually almost full and you don't know if a table is available. The waiters aren't always ready to tell you if and where a table is available and you either have to wait until the waiter finds out, or, in the worst case, go and look around the place yourself. 
This app is designed to solve exactly this problem. Thanks to a clear interface, which reflects the real scheme of the place, customers and waiters will always know where and what tables are free / booked and for when each tables are reserved, which will greatly facilitate the work of the staff and improve clients expirience form visiting you restaurant.
This app allows to change the status of tables in different sectors, add reservation to the tables and provides a visual interface to display the status of tables in the sector.
