      <p>
        Imagine a restaurant or pub that has two or more floors or several halls
        for visitors. On weekends, most restaurants are usually almost full and
        you don't know if a table is available. The waiters aren't always ready
        to tell you if and where a table is available and you either have to
        wait until the waiter finds out, or, in the worst case, go and look
        around the place yourself. <br />
        This app is designed to solve exactly this problem. Thanks to a clear
        interface, which reflects the real scheme of the place, customers and
        waiters will always know where and what tables are free / booked and for
        when each tables are reserved, which will greatly facilitate the work of
        the staff and improve clients expirience form visiting you restaurant.
